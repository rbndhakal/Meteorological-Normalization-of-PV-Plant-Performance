# Meteorological-Normalization-of-PV-Plant-Performance
Analysis of solar PV plant data obtained from 2.75 MW solar PV power plant
I am not able to upload larger files here. So, the dataset file uploaded is a sample dataset file.
There are different techniques of data filtering of solar data obtained from real PV plant. 
Normalization of PV plant performance is done using regression tree model.
