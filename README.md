# Meteorological-Normalization-of-PV-Plant-Performance
In this project i have perform the following analysis and prepare a short, 30-minute presentation summarizing the methodology and results. This exercise is designed to demonstrate the analytical, programming, and presentation skills for solar PV data analysis.
 
The sample dataset (the analysis is based on total dataset) contains electrical and meteorological data from a PV plant. Following task was performed on the data: 
 
1.	Data Quality Control/Filtering
  a.	Finding and showing erroneous (physically impossible/unlikely) data points
  b.	Design of a filter(s) to remove them and implement filter(s)
  c.	Identify other issues in the data.
  d.	Show data quality issues and explain possible causes 
2.	Use the meteorological data to normalize PV plant performance. 
3.	Analyze plant performance
  a.	Showing any insights obtained on the plant design, rating, or configuration? What information can you gather about the plant?
  b.	Showing any insights on performance over time. 
4.	Describing any future work or ideas i would pursue (if any) given more time (1 year for example) on the project
 
(The sample data is in csv and but in the code pickle format is used. The pickle format can be ready by pandas directly into a dataframe to safe the time of formatting the index timestamp)
